# Loan-Approval-Predicition
Our prediction model is designed to accurately forecast whether a loan application will be approved or rejected. The primary goal is to use historical data such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and property area to uncover patterns that determine loan approval. This model seeks to replace the traditional, often subjective manual evaluation process with a data-driven approach, which can improve consistency and speed in decision-making. By automating the loan approval assessment, we aim to reduce the risk of approving loans that might lead to defaults, while ensuring deserving applicants receive timely funding. In essence, our objective is to streamline the loan evaluation process, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and fairness in financial lending practices.
